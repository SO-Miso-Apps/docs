# SO: llms.txt FAQs

1. What is llms.txt and why does my store need it? Think of llms.txt as a specialized sitemap designed for AI (like ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini). While standard SEO targets Google Search, this file helps AI assistants clearly understand your products, prices, and policies, increasing the chance of your items being recommended in AI-generated conversations.

2. Will this app slow down my website loading speed? Absolutely not. We generate and host your llms.txt file on an external global CDN (Cloudflare R2), separate from your Shopline theme's assets. When an AI bot requests the file, it is served from our high-speed edge servers, ensuring zero impact on your storefront's performance for human visitors.

3. How often is the data updated? Does it handle stock changes? The app works in real-time. We listen to your store's webhooks, so whenever you update a product's price, description, or inventory level, our system automatically regenerates your AI context file. This ensures AI bots never recommend out-of-stock items or quote outdated prices.

4. Do I need to know coding to install this? No coding skills are required. The app automatically configures the necessary settings and injects the required meta tags into your store's header to guide AI bots to your file. It is a "plug-and-play" solution designed for non-technical merchants.

5. Which AI platforms can read this file? The llms.txt standard is rapidly being adopted by major AI crawlers. Currently, it is optimized for bots from OpenAI (ChatGPT), Anthropic (Claude), Google (Gemini), and Perplexity AI, helping your store get "read" correctly by the most popular AI assistants in the world.
