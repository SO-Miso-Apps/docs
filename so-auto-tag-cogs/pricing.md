## Understanding Limits

### Operations
An "operation" is counted each time the app processes a webhook event (e.g., new order, customer update) or performs a bulk action item.

### COGS Products
This limit refers to the number of product cost updates you can make per month, not the total products in your store.

### What happens when I reach a limit?
- **Rules:** You cannot create or enable new rules beyond the limit. Existing active rules continue to work.
- **Operations:** Once exhausted, new webhook events will be queued until the next billing cycle or upgrade.
- **COGS:** You will be notified and cannot update costs until the next cycle.

## How to Upgrade

1. Go to **Settings** > **Billing** in the app.
2. Review plan features and click **Upgrade** on your preferred plan.
3. Confirm through Shopify's billing system.
4. Your new limits are applied immediately.

## How to Check Your Usage

1. Open any feature page (Smart Tagger, COGS, Bulk Operations, etc.).
2. Look at the **usage banner** at the top showing current usage vs. limit.
3. The progress bar indicates how much of your quota has been used.

## FAQs

**What happens if I reach the rule limit on the Free plan?**
You will not be able to create new rules or enable existing ones if the count exceeds 5 for Smart Tagger or 5 for Metafield Manager. To add more, you must either delete/disable existing rules or upgrade to the **Basic** or **Pro** plan.

**Can I use the "Revert" feature on all plans?**
No, the **Revert** feature (which undoes bulk operations) is exclusive to the **Pro** and **Pro Annual** plans. On Free or Basic plans, bulk operations cannot be undone automatically.

**When does my usage quota reset?**
All usage quotas (operations, COGS updates, AI trials) reset at the beginning of each billing cycle – either monthly or annually depending on your plan.

**How can I check my remaining AI quota?**
When creating a new rule, look at the AI Magic Generator section. If you're on the Free plan, it will show "X of 5 trials remaining". For Basic and Pro plans, AI usage is unlimited.

**What happens if I downgrade my plan?**
- Existing rules remain but may be disabled if they exceed the new plan's limits.
- You'll need to manually disable rules to get within the new limit.
- Already-entered COGS data is preserved.

**Can I switch between monthly and annual billing?**
Yes, you can switch at any time from the Billing page. When upgrading to annual, you'll get prorated credit for any unused days on your current plan.
